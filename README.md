## Introduction
Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. As a beginner, I've embarked on this journey to learn Python and have created this repository to share my basic exercises, code, and progress with the programming community.

## Exercises
I've worked on a variety of basic Python exercises, including but not limited to:
- **Hello World**: The classic beginner's program to display "Hello, World!" on the screen.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Exercises on working with variables, data types, and basic data manipulation.
- **Control Flow**: Demonstrating my understanding of conditionals and loops.
- **Functions**: Creating and using functions in Python.
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: Exploring data structures and their operations.
- **File Handling**: Basic file input/output operations in Python.
- **Error Handling**: Dealing with exceptions and errors.
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects or tasks I've completed to apply what I've learned.

Feel free to explore the various directories in this repository to see my code and how I approached each exercise.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `exercises/`: Contains subdirectories for each exercise, including Python scripts and documentation.
- `projects/`: For any mini projects or more complex exercises.
- `documentation/`: Any additional documentation, notes, or resources that I've found useful during my learning journey.
